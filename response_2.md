## The Water Cycle

  The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It's a complex system with several stages, but can be simplified into:

  **1. Evaporation:** Water changes from a liquid state to a gas (vapor) through sunlight and heat. This occurs from oceans, lakes, rivers, even leaves of plants (transpiration).

  **2. Condensation:** Water vapor cools and condenses into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.

  **3. Precipitation:** Water droplets in clouds become heavy enough to fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

  **4. Collection:** Once on land, precipitation can:
      * Flow over the surface (runoff) into streams, rivers, and oceans.
      * Soak into the ground (infiltration), replenishing groundwater stores.
      * Evaporate again, restarting the cycle.

  **5. Storage:** Water is stored in various reservoirs:
      * Oceans (most water)
      * Ice caps and glaciers
      * Groundwater
      * Lakes and rivers
      * Atmosphere

  **Additional notes:**

      * The water cycle plays a crucial role in Earth's climate, weather patterns, and ecosystems.
      * Human activities can impact the water cycle through pollution, water usage, and climate change.
