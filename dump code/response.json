It's a complex system with several stages, but can be simplified into:\n\n  **1. Evaporation:** Water changes from a liquid state to a gas (vapor) through sunlight and heat. This occurs from oceans, lakes, rivers, even leaves of plants (transpiration).\n\n  **2. Condensation:** Water vapor cools and condenses into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.\n\n  **3. Precipitation:** Water droplets in clouds become heavy enough to fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n  **4. Collection:** Once on land, precipitation can:\n      * Flow over the surface (runoff) into streams, rivers, and oceans.\n      * Soak into the ground (infiltration), replenishing groundwater stores.\n      * Evaporate again, restarting the cycle.\n\n  **5. Storage:** Water is stored in various reservoirs:\n      * Oceans (most water)\n      * Ice caps and glaciers\n      * Groundwater\n      * Lakes and rivers\n      * Atmosphere\n\n  **Additional notes:**\n\n      * The water cycle plays a crucial role in Earth's climate, weather patterns, and ecosystems.\n      * Human activities can impact the water cycle through pollution, water usage, and climate change.\n\n  **Further exploration:**\n\n      * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): [https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/watercycle/](https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/watercycle/)\n      * NASA: [https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/](https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/)\n\n  **Note:** This is a general overview of the water cycle. The specific details of the cycle can vary depending on location and other factors."
