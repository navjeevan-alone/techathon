# The Water Cycle

The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It's a complex system, but can be simplified into several key stages:

**1. Evaporation:** Sunlight and heat turn liquid water into gas (vapor). This happens from oceans, lakes, rivers, and even through plant leaves (transpiration).

**2. Condensation:** Water vapor cools and condenses into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.

**3. Precipitation:** Water droplets in clouds grow heavy and fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

**4. Collection:** Once on land, precipitation can:
    - Flow over the surface (runoff) into streams, rivers, and oceans.
    - Soak into the ground (infiltration), replenishing groundwater stores.
    * Evaporate again, restarting the cycle.

**5. Storage:** Water is stored in various reservoirs:
    * Oceans (most water)
    * Ice caps and glaciers
    * Groundwater
    * Lakes and rivers
    * Atmosphere

**Additional notes:**
* The water cycle plays a crucial role in Earth's climate, weather patterns, and ecosystems.
* Human activities can impact the water cycle through pollution, water usage, and climate change.
