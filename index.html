  <h1>The Water Cycle</h1>
  
  <p>The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It's a complex system with several stages, but can be simplified into:</p>

  <h2>1. Evaporation</h2>
  <p>☀️ Water changes from a liquid state to a gas (vapor) through sunlight and heat. This occurs from oceans, lakes, rivers, even leaves of plants (transpiration).</p>

  <h2>2. Condensation</h2>
  <p>☁️ Water vapor cools and condenses into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.</p>

  <h2>3. Precipitation</h2>
  <p>️ As water droplets in clouds get heavy, they fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.</p>

  <h2>4. Collection</h2>
  <p>️ Once on land, precipitation can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flow over the surface (runoff) into streams, rivers, and oceans.</li>
    <li>Soak into the ground (infiltration), replenishing groundwater stores.</li>
    <li>Evaporate again, restarting the cycle.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Storage</h2>
  <p> Water is stored in various reservoirs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oceans (most water)</li>
    <li>Ice caps and glaciers</li>
    <li>Groundwater</li>
    <li>Lakes and rivers</li>
    <li>Atmosphere</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Additional notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The water cycle plays a crucial role in Earth's climate, weather patterns, and ecosystems.</li>
    <li>Human activities can impact the water cycle through pollution, water usage, and climate change.</li>
  </ul>
